The **leftover hosts** are also used on [eieiDNS](https://eieidns.com) that provided and created by [@pakonda](https://github.com/pakonda) however, I cannot control the whitelist and maybe it's suitable for not too stricting to block some domains. (I did add blacklisted hosts by means of personal issue and nothing more...)

Anyway, you can show support to eieiDNS by [say thanks](https://saythanks.io/to/pakonda) or [buy a coffee (Ko-Fi)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V0KGVT).
