# This is a custom list that not yet categorized!

As usual, only uBlock Origin (also other forks, but I don't recommend anything of those except [Nano](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore)) can use the list that I've created, due to..
- No `[AdBlock Plus x.xx]` compatibility header.
- Have many syntax that AdBlock Plus cannot understand!
  - Also [old uBlock](https://github.com/uBlock-LLC/uBlock), and you should avoid it as possible! ([1](https://github.com/uBlock-LLC/uBlock/commit/76b89c0a22d20f3a66d7feab14e024f56ca65539), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8k4ot6))
