# This is a custom list that not yet categorized

As usual, only uBlock Origin (also other forks, but I don't recommend others except Nano) can use the list that I've created, due to..
- No `[AdBlock Plus x.xx]` compatibility header.
- Have many syntax that AdBlock Plus doesn't support! (include old uBlock, [and you should avoid it!](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8k4ot6))
