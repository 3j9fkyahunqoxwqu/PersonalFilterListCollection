This aim to eliminate every ads on Gelbooru without allowing any ads, even it's served or generated from site itself.

But this list was designed to use with **uBlock Origin** only, I strongly **not support AdBlockPlus**.

> *You know why.*

Also I'm not responsible of any broken function on that site if you use this list and combined with **EasyList** or **Fanboy List** because it's messed some functionality (like hide search bar, page number, or something else that matter to use.)

> Unless you've found my filterlist was broke some function and surely it's this filterlist false, if you're not sure, you can check the logger and report back to me via [issue dashboard](https://github.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/issues).

I recommended to use other lists, such as Hosts File, AdGuard or any lists that really understand your privacy. 

> meaning it's not allow third party resources to load for unbreak, such as allow ads script from `ExoClick` to prevent **[Plan B](https://github.com/kowith337/GelboLube/wiki/Blocking-rule-explanation#ublock-resource-injection-rule)** method to serve ads.

This will work greater if you use with **uBo + Firefox** (or any fork that's suitable to you, such as CyberFox, IceCat, Pale moon, WaterFox)
