### A Personal collections of filterlists that can use with uBlock Origin, uMatrix or as hosts file

This repo will have some collection of filterlists that I've created, each list are work only for some specific sites.

Currently known have filterlist for

- uBlock Origin / Nano Adblocker
  - APKMirror
  - Facebook (Mostly mobile layout)
  - Gelbooru + TheDoujin [(Moved from this repo)](https://github.com/kowith337/gelbolube)
  - Uncategorised sites
- Hosts File
  - block leftover and/or (not|un-) blocked hosts
  - block `Google` tracking that connect `adservice.google.com` and `id.google.com`, include regional domains.
  - block all Facebook Free Basics servers that redirect to an alternative subdomains, also load resources from other servers that different than normal connections

Include other things

- Documentation about setting up advanced blockers (uBlock0 / Nano), DNS lists for DNS66, etc.
- uMatrix rulesets for Thai sites (Testing)

The **leftover hosts** are also used on [eieiDNS](https://eieidns.com) that provided and created by [@pakonda](https://github.com/pakonda) however, I cannot control the whitelist and maybe it's suitable for not too stricting to block some domains. (I did add blacklisted hosts by means of personal issues and nothing more...)

Anyway, you can show support to eieiDNS by [say thanks](https://saythanks.io/to/pakonda) or [buy a coffee (Ko-Fi)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V0KGVT).

More things will be listed, if available...
